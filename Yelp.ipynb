       "[\"Went with a friend for brunch today.Read the reviews and was in the area so both my friend and were down to try. I thought there would be a long wait but there wasn't. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by several staff and seated in under a minute. It was busy, as brunch in BK typically is, but our waiter remained attentive and was friendly. We did not feel rushed. I felt welcomed throughout the experience. I ordered the sweet potato pancakes and corn beef hash and my friend ordered sweet potato waffle sausage and eggs. We shared all the food, it was good and I would definitely return. Cash only but there is an ATM conveniently inside.\",\n",
       " 'Five years. Five years since you last set foot in your old neighborhood, since you packed your bags and moved back home. Your last meal was at your favorite diner. Your heart beats loudly as you walk back in.You sit at your old booth. You\\'re shocked by how cheap it is - or rather, you remember how pricey it seemed to you back then. The server comes, friendly as fuck. You order a cheeseburger with fries and Thousand Island. \"I\\'ll do you better than One Thousand Island,\" he says. \"I\\'ll give you Two Thousand Island!\" You laugh at the funny joke. He leaves. Garlic bread arrives for Ian\\'s spaghetti and meatballs. Garrett awaits his tuna melt. Grace awaits her broccoli omelet. The food arrives, and what you thought to be a joke turns out to be all too true: along with your cheeseburger, the server hands you two packets of Newman\\'s Own One Thousand Island dressing, except \"One\" is crossed out and replaced with \"Two\" (it\\'s printed like this, in different font). You slather the deep orange-and-green-flecked condiment on the top bun and assemble, low-key anticipating the best cheeseburger ever.It\\'s not. The patty is over-cooked. Ian\\'s spaghetti is watery and has small chunks of green peppers in it. Garrett\\'s tuna melt seems alright, as does Grace\\'s omelet. You\\'re too full to want dessert but you feel like you should get something, so after much debate you split a chocolate milkshake with Garrett. Is it made with chocolate ice cream and chocolate syrup or is it made with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup? It\\'s impossible to tell. It tastes like when you made chocolate milk as a kid and it doesn\\'t mix well, but still, you DRINK IT UP. The biting sweetness lingers on your tongue. You take out your cash and hand it to Ian, who pays. It\\'s colder outside than when you first walked in, or maybe you just need to readjust. You remember you looked forward to the lemon ricotta pancakes, but all you remember is the sharp taste of lemon zest. Did you ever really like them? A smile creeps across your face. Garrett, discrete, lights a joint.',\n",
       " \"This place is kinda refreshing in yuppy brooklyn -- nice to go to a pretty cheap pretty standard diner. I know lots of people who are crazy about it but it didn't strike me that way. We had a bunch of egg options and shared a pancake platter. Thumbs up for the different flavored butters that come with the pancakes! If you love huge fluffy diner pancakes then this place is definitely for you -- just not my personal preference.I would definitely go on a week day when you don't have to wait; for me it wouldn't be worth the weekend lines.\",\n",

Danish pancakes (ricotta, lemon zest and blueberries). My girlfriend got pancakes. The pancakes were amazing. Golden brown on the outside, fluffy but dense with ricotta on the inside, just the right amount of lemon, and didn't even need any of the syrup or flavored butters that come with. (I might try without blueberries next time).Other. Eggs were done well. Meatloaf, we heard, was made on site, and pretty straight forward and somewhat plain, not particularly flavorful. Home fries were ok, could use some more onion. Everything straight forward. O.K. not particularly remarkable.We didn't know there was another seating area, which we might try next time. The ambience was i guess what people go for. Old-school. The wait people were attentive and helpful. Would go again.\",\n",

Cash only!Ordered the Danish pancakes (lemon zest, ricotta and Parmesan cheese, blueberries) and it was a giant plate of three. Fluffy and moist, it was particularly fun to try them out with the different containers of strawberry, maple and cinnamon flavored butters. Very filling, could not finish entire plate in one sitting.Husband had corned beef hash and eggs with French fries and the fries were amazing, perfectly crispy. I unapologetically ate half his fries.

I looked around the restaurant and also saw other patrons unable to finish *any* of their pancakes.

       " 'We like visiting an old diner that has been in business for a long time, with lots of loyal local customers. We found one in Brooklyn when we visited Brooklyn Museum. This diner is family owned operated since 1936! You need to go down to the mid way between the entrance and the back wall, where they have a sign that says \"wait to be seated.\" It was packed on a weekend during lunch time. A staff came by quickly and told us there will be a few minutes wait. After a few minutes, we were taken to what looked like an outside area from the main restaurant.It was an add-on to the restaurant (I assume), with lots of windows. It was full Christmas mode in there, even though we were visiting during Summer time. A good way to save time and cost with no need to re-decorate for the holidays. LOL. As soon as we sat, the staff asked if we wanted coffee, this is not that kind of a place where you take your sweet time to decide what to eat and drink. For food, we ordered Special 2 by 2 by 2 Combo, Crab Cakes and Eggs, and Tom\\'s Beer Batter Fillet Sandwich. The portion was huge, not anything fancy but tasty and the kind of food that soothes your soul. We had a nice lunch here, we were completely stuffed and still took some left over home. They serve breakfast all day, so you can have breakfast any time of the day. The one thing to remember, is that they are CASH ONLY. Make sure you bring cash! The staffs were nice, not always easy to grab someone since they are always busy, but they are attentive enough.',\n",
       " \"Finally made a trip to Tom's the past weekend. It's legit an old school diner, located blocks away from the Brooklyn Botanic and Brooklyn Museum. I thought the service was pretty good, the atmosphere quirky yet inviting, the food was mostly tasty. I particularly enjoyed the spicy mayo sauce provided at the table. The wait time for a table was pretty minimal, perhaps 10 min wait at most on a Saturday. I ordered the Crab Cakes Florentine with side of fries and my guest had eggs with bacon. We shared Danish Pancakes. They advertise the 'freshly made' crab cakes all over the restaurant, I figured I'd give it a shot. Normally, I wouldn't go for this, and I probably wouldn't again from here. It wasn't terrible, but the crab cakes were quite rich and heavy, as one could expect. The crab is imitation crab meat. The spinach was way, way too salty. It's much too heavy on the feta. It could use more spinach to cut that richness of the crab cakes. I actually thought this dish came with poached eggs, but later realized it did not. I ordered a side of poached eggs after the fact, and it made a postive difference. I think by default, it should come with poached eggs(?). The fries were pretty great, nice and crispy. Overall though, I was quite disappointed by my dish. The Danish Pancakes were otherwise very good, and I'd order those again. My guest noted a strange flavor from his bacon. I am going to guess it's from the residual cooking grease on the grill. The food was fine, but I was sad I didn't come to like the crab cakes florentine very much. It was a pretty heavy meal for breakfast. Everything else was generally okay. If dining here, I recommend the pancakes. Their spicy mayo makes a great condiment to the fries. I thought the service was good. If you're planning to be in the area and are looking for some decent breakfast, I'd give Tom's a shot.\",\n",
       " \"Tom's is was awesome.I arrived with my friend around 1:30 on a Sunday and there was about a 20min wait. Everyone just forms a line out the door and they'll call different party numbers. Although.... they kept come around with this amazing beef sausage with a lil squeeze of fresh lemon juice. I would come back just to stand in line.We got lucky with 2 seats at the bar. I ordered a spinach omelet with feta, and my friend ordered a veggie omelet with fries. They brought us round 2 of free samples and gave use a whole pancake on the house. Obviously, it was wonderful. One of our orders had the wrong cheese, and the other one the wrong side. Honestly, who cares. It was delicious, and there are no regrets. I also got the turkey bacon (basically real bacon) and a side of sliced tomatoes to minimize carb intake. I can't wait to come back to Tom's and that wild beef sausage!\",\n",
       " \"I love a good diner. Tom's was quaint, with a classic eclectic diner feel. When my friend and I first got there we thought we were going to be waiting for hours, but it took only a few minutes. The servers are nice and prompt. My problem was that the food that I got wasn't the best. I would go back, but for something else on their menu. I ordered the cinnamon pancakes and they were so dry. I had to keep dumping more syrup. Also, since it's a diner, of course, it has to be CASH ONLY. But, this place is very cheap, so they have that going for it. This place was cute, but I wouldn't go out of my way (unless I was in the area).\",\n",

You can get it to go. I appreciate the free fruit. I've never understood the line for this place though. Like the food is typical diner food. Corned beef hash from the can, basic eggs, waffles, pancakes, etc. Maybe it's the experience people are seeking or it's the thing to do? Not sure but it's a cool neighborhood spot. Not worth standing on line for, but cool if you can get seated quickly.\",\n",
       " \"Very friendly service and quality fluffly pancakes served with syrup and three types of flavored butter: maple, cinnamon and strawberry.Interior is also very warm and inviting. The bathroom is small but immaculate, that should \\xa0always tell you about the cleanliness of the restaurant overall.Very nice experience overall but very pricey for pancakes, coffee and a side. If you are nearby and would like a different pancake experince stop by Tom's.\",\n",

They can cook your eggs in a variety of ways, whether it be an omelette, scrambled or sunny side up. We ordered the Danish pancakes, which I believe had some blueberries in them. Their pancakes here are moist and aren't dry. It had good batter. We also ordered the huevos rancheros which is basically cheese, rice, slice of ham, some mushy hash browns sprinkled with cheese and a dash of hot sauce. The hot sauce tasted like tapatio sauce, but who knows...They also give you a side of sour cream for you to mix in if you enjoy it. Service was attentive and friendly. Place was packed, and I assume it gets super packed in the weekends. If you're taking the subways, it's a bit of a walk to the restaurant, about 9 minutes or so. They take cash only so I suggest you give yourself a favor and visit your bank to withdraw some cash to avoid ATM fees.\",\n",
       " \"American breakfast and the portions are BIG! Crab cakes were great but a bit salty. The Dutch Pancake was my favorite with the strawberry spread and cinnamon spread. 3 large pancakes plus our own entrees were too much. Sad we couldn't finish our meal but worth it. Prices are not overly expensive in this day and age. Reasonable pricing that won't dent your pocket. CASH only!! Also get there early cause chances are there will be a line. After we got seated, a line started forming. There are more seatings in the back towards the side. Overall, great brunch!\",\n",

We noticed plenty of empty booths around and 6 servers but only 1 was actually working ! The other servers were standing around or moving and acting busy but not really doing much . Hmmm not sure what was going on. They didn't even serve us water when we were finally seated. My son had to ask for water and it didn't come and then we asked a second time and then got it.

Three nicely stacked pancakes filled with cinnamon goodness. We drizzled the maple syrup on top and lathered on the cinnamon butter. It was breakfast dessert on fluffy pancake clouds.

Went on to the huevos rancheros and definitely on the first bite confirmed that this place was not focused on quality. The beans lacked salt and flavor along with the rice which tasted like it was reheated but both were just opened from a can. The tortillas on the huevos rancheros are known for being crunchy.

It was packed inside, with a line to wait to be seated, so I used that as indication that the food was going to be fire, and boy was I right. The crab cakes and eggs breakfast was slammin'. \\xa0The eggs were fluffy and the crab cakes were crunchy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. \\xa0The spicy remoulade sauce it came with was delicious. They move quick here so the wait wasn't long to get seated, order, and recieve food. The wait staff are both friendly and efficient, and checked up on my friend and I frequently throughout our meal. I can see why this place is so popular, Tom's provides good food in a nice homely atmosphere.\",\n",

I love the small-town feel thanks to the consistent, warm hospitality of waiters who actually seem to like their job. Going to Tom's is a yummy treat that I recommend you give a try if you're in Brooklyn and near the Brooklyn Museum.\",\n",

I can eat pancakes at any hour of the day. I just love pancakes!Sadly, my chocolate chip pancakes were dry. My omelette was even drier if that was possible. Truthfully the bacon omelette was absolutely inedible. My boyfriend's fish sandwich was delicious though, and is the only reason this place got 3 stars. Based on my food alone it'd probably be 1.5/5 stars...\",\n",

The restaurant wasn\\'t too crowded but we did have to wait a bit for a table to free up. We split the Danish pancakes (which are blueberry pancakes with a hint of ricotta) and a side of scrambled eggs and bacon. The food was delicious! The pancakes came with three spreads which I believe are a cinnamon spread, maple spread, and strawberry spread (they didn\\'t explain what the spreads were, so I\\'m not 100% sure on this). The pancakes were so fluffy and flavorful (not at all dry). When combined with the spreads, it\\'s a great combination of flavor and satisfaction with every bite. I forgot that they even gave us syrup because I didn\\'t need to drench my pancake with syrup like I usually do.I\\'ll definitely come here again for breakfast/brunch!Please note, this is CASH ONLY, which I wasn\\'t aware of before coming because I didn\\'t check Yelp properly!

Just the right amount of sweetness for me. I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs and those were good too. My friend had the Dutch blueberry pancakes which were also delicious. My only complaint about this restaurant is that it's cash only. Really? Come on now... that's annoying. Luckily they have an ATM machine inside.

       " \"Went here on a whim with a friend. We were starving and the all day breakfast food menu really appealed to the both of us. The atmosphere was super cute--very old school diner vibes which reminded me of Gilmore Girls. We were told to take a seat anywhere. While my friend and I were disappointed that it was cash only, there was an ATM in the diner and the fee was only $2 which is not bad.Now, let's talk about the service. I am not sure why there was only one waitress for the whole diner considering how busy it was, but it took her almost 15-20 minutes to get to our table--and this was before the dinner crowd rolled in. She did not seem to be very knowledgeable about the menu and got really confused when asked questions. She also was not very good at refilling our water which I think is the least you can do. To add on, the utensils we got were poorly cleaned and we had to ask for a replacement...All this, however, was not as annoying as having to wait almost an hour to get our food and that seemed to be a trend for every table. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or what but an hour's wait is ridiculous especially for a diner.As for the food, I ordered the chocolate cake french toast and the onion and pepper omelette with a side of fries and toast. My friend ordered the chocolate chip pancakes with a side of the homemade fries. The food came in huge portions for the price, but in my opinion, was not that special. The chocolate cake french toast was literally just chocolate pound cake with whipped cream. The omelette was ok...not as fluffy as expected. I did enjoy the fries though. My friend really liked the pancakes but felt they were overly sweet and could not finish them. She did not like the homemade fries, and when I tasted them, we both agreed that they tasted old and not fresh. The waitress though was nice enough to replace them and get her fresh batch.Overall, the diner is cute and the food options are plenty, however, don't expect too much in terms of the food...it's pretty mediocre. I would just pass on this place next time, you know, unless I go and block out an hour in my schedule just to wait on my food -.-\",\n",

The pancakes were nice and fluffy with little chunks of mango and little bits and pieces of walnuts scattered throughout the pancake. I liked the pancake batter and the fluffiness but I don't think mangoes go well in a pancake. U only taste the mango if that particular piece you're eating has mango in it. Otherwise, it's mostly just pancake. I thought it would be like a banana walnut pancake where the banana aroma goes throughout the pancake, but it is not so with the mango. My bf ordered a platter, and replaced the plain pancakes with chocolate chip pancakes for an extra $2. I liked his chocolate chip pancakes better. The platter also comes with eggs, and choice of bacon or sausage, (we asked for both) and we also ordered a side of home fries. We ordered scrambled eggs, and they were fluffy. The bacon was good when it was still hot. Slightly salty but not bad. The sausage was good. The home fries lacked flavor so we drizzled it with ketchup and pepper.They also have a couple of special spread/butter you can put on your pancakes.

The walls look like they belong to an antique or thrift shop, packed top to bottom with pictures, paintings, knickknacks as well as newspaper reviews of the place. Food is standard diner food, large portions. Saw a lot of people going for pancakes but husband and I wanted something savory. Got burger, and egg Florentine. The burger was really good, the eggs were perfectly poached. I wasn\\'t a huge fan of the spinach feta mix, it was a little too salty for me. The hollandaise was not exactly that. But honestly, who cares, it\\'s a classic diner and I wasn\\'t looking for \"authentic\" hollandaise, just comforting poached eggs spinach and fries. I would definitely come back when in the neighborhood. Great service too, and super reasonably priced.',\n",
       " \"This diner was recommended to me by a fellow Brooklynite who loves pancakes. I came on a Sunday morning at 11 am and found the line literally outside the door. I hadn't been here before so when I tried to go around the line to put my name down, I was told to wait in line and that the wait was only 15 minutes. They don't have a host/hostess so you have to wait in line until you reach the front for a table. While that might sound like an ineffective method to seat people, they do come around with waters and delicious french fries and other various foods for you to sample while standing in line. While we did end up actually waiting 30 minutes instead of the predicted 15 minutes for the table, the wait wasn't bad and the food comes relatively quickly. I ordered the 2 by 2 by 2 special which comes with eggs, bacon or sausage, and pancakes. The scrambled eggs were sub par, but the sausage and pancakes were delicious. The pancakes were just the right amount of fluffiness. My friend ordered the corn beef hash which was also average, it only had potatoes and corn beef in it, and I was hoping for some sort of vegetables to go with it. Some of their dishes come with french fries, which I HIGHLY recommend. Overall service is also average and what you could expect at a diner (although our waiter did forget to bring us water). \\xa0I would come back just for the pancakes and maybe try out one of their lunch dishes.Just a tip: if you're a lover of french fries like I am, I would order one of the dishes that comes with it, and it's NOT to be confused with the home fries. Home fries are basically mashed potato chunks.\",\n",

But they are very efficient in seating and serving, without rushing you! Once when I was waiting online they had a waiter walking with the line serving us some top menus items. Delish! Cash Only!

For a table of three, we over ordered, but we really wanted everything! I must come back. We got the:1. Crab Cakes Florentine - the portion is so large! The crab cakes were amazing and spinach was cooked well. Not to mention, the crab cakes were huge! I got mine with a side of home fries (comes with it). The home fries were delicious. \\xa02. Danish pancakes - hands down, the best pancakes I have ever had. I think if I died tomorrow, I'll be satisfied because of these pancakes 3. Chocolate cake French Toast - bomb.dom! This was sooooo good! Between, the danish pancakes and the toast, I felt like I was cheating on them both. Couldn't decide which one was the best 4. Cinnamon bun pancakes - by this time, I was too full to fully appreciate these pancakes, but I had a sliver and it was really amazing too. Tastes exactly like cinnamon buns! I also was feeling sausage, so I got a turkey sausage (don't know if it was the hunger from the race or what, but it was excellent! I also got the cherry lime Rickey too. It was so tasty and refreshing. My cousin's boyfriend also got a plate - can't remember, didn't try, so won't comment. He liked it!!!The waiters were really nice!\",\n",

It is probably best to be seated in their enclosed addition area because if you are sitting in the main area, and there begins to be a line, I can imagine it can get quite hectic and stressful during the meal. I know when I was trying to exit, I had to excuse myself from brushing past so many people who were dining and made sure I didn't take their plates down. I tried their Danish pancakes which is lemon ricotta with blueberries. Based on all the other raving reviews, I guess I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong. The pancakes were good! But they just were not amazing. Maybe it would be have been better if it had been stuffed pancakes. My husband, however, LOVED his corned beef hash and said it was absolutely delicious.\",\n",

You can go to any other diner in New York and be just as satisfied.\",\n",
       " \"For egg creams (those fountain drinks of yore that contain neither egg nor cream, but rather seltzer water and milk with either chocolate syrup or vanilla flavoring), Tom's can't be beat. However, I was nonplussed by the food and service. Their entrees and sides are heavy, often greasy, and lacking in subtlety. When I requested lettuce leaves instead of a bun with my burger, I was forced to order the deluxe with tomato and fries, which I didn't want, along with the lettuce. The burger still was served on a bun. It's a good thing I'm not allergic to gluten; I just try to avoid it to maintain a healthy lower-carb diet. Tom's is no place for the health- or weight-conscious. If I return, it will be to sit at the counter for a chocolate egg cream or a lime rickey on a splurge or cheat day.\",\n",

I ordered a veggie omelet and grits she got one of the egg specials with bacon and hash browns; we split an order of banana walnut pancakes. Everything was just ok...definitely nothing to write home about...all. The potatoes were dry, my omelet was cooked really, really hard (see pic) and the grits were just abig heaping, with no love at all put into them (much less some salt). We kept thinking \"well they\\'re known for the pancakes...those will be awesome!\" - WRONG. They too were extremely dry...Flavor was good but texture was all wrong. I think we missed that the banana pancakes also had walnuts (the menu read banana OR apple walnut pancakes) and they were big walnut chunks sparsely thrown in.

I ordered cinnamon roll pancakes (definitely too much for one person-stack of 3 large cakes) which reminded me so much of old fashioned pancakes-very cake like. YUM. In addition, I ordered a filet of Sole and cheese eggs, which also came with toast and home fries. I assumed the fish would be grilled but to my surprise it was beer battered w/the cheese eggs served right on top. The home fries were scrumptious, so much like how my dad prepares them- soft, buttery w/a slight crisp coating. Oh, and the cherry limeade Rickey was a wonderful addition. I was so pleased that we made a point to stop by again before leaving the city. This is now my favorite breakfast in Brooklyn.\",\n",

Second, realize that you will get diner-sized portions. DO NOT come here unless you're hungry. An order of pancakes comes with 3 massive, delicious, amazing, fluffy, ... (getting a little bit sidetracked) ... pancakes. My favorites are the Lemon Ricotta pancakes, Danish pancakes (if you want lemon ricotta with blueberries), and the Harvest pancakes (sweet corn and cranberries). Even if I skip dinner, I can never finish an order of these pancakes, but I always get a side of eggs and bacon. When will I learn? The service and decor are great.

I managed to capture it with an empty glass. I called the waiter over and showed him and he killed it but still... I've never had something happen like that to me ever before. I've seen roaches outside on the sidewalk, near trash cans, etc. but I never expected to see one on the table I'm eating at during the day!!! No thanks! They comped our meal which was nice and I left them a decent tip as a result but we'd never go back. The waiter said it was from the people who lived in the apartment upstairs. That seemed like more of an excuse and that this was not the first time they experienced something like this. They had an A health score too!

You stand in a line and moves quickly. The staff waste no time seating people quick fast and in a hurry. When the line grows, well good luck because it goes out the door and they do not take names.

While my family member enjoyed waffle and bacon. Once the food hit the table I was ready to dive in but wait it had a few drawbacks. My steak was large and in charge but cooked to all hell (I swear I could taste the gristle of the grill on it) but still had flavor and was succulent. Not to mention I had ordered grits not potatoes (it was never corrected in the end), eggs were good and my family member's food was hot (for once)*side bar: anywhere we go we end up always being served last or behind several people who sat down after us this place was no different*Even so, the service was still excellent, friendly, and there is a small outside eating area as well.

When it came out the portions were decent, but it honestly didn't look that great. The eggs were this brownish color that meant that was overcooked on the pan. I took a bite and the texture was dry and a little dusty because it was cooked too long. The side potatoes were bland and didn't have much taste or flavor, the dish was disappointing and mediocre at best. The Benedict also didn't look that great either, rather simple ingredients thrown together with the hollandaise sauce a goopy mess that looked very similar to melted yellow plastic. LOL. But awesome thing was that the tea and coffee has free refills and the staff was able to provide me with a bottle of honey for the tea!I don't know...

       " \"This feels like a real diner. Manhattan diners are overpriced and sometimes not even that good. This is the real deal! Great eggs, huge pancakes, CASH ONLY but totally worth it. I'm so glad I moved closer to here so I can go here instead of for overpriced brunch.\",\n",
       " \"A friend and I came here for brunch during a weekday because I heard good things about their pancakes. When you first walk in, it seems like it's such a small place, but in actuality, there's more space on the side, but it's still a little tight. \\xa0Anyway, my friend and I were quickly seated and I already knew what I was going to order, Danish pancakes! We also ordered the steak and eggs with sweet potato fries as well as coffee and a cherry lime rickey. So what distinguishes Danish pancakes from regular pancakes? I honestly don't know, but I'd imagine it's because they are more cake like in consistency. They were made with blueberries and hints of lemon and ricotta. Anyway, they were good and don't even get me started on the flavored butters, love them!My friend's steak and eggs were like anywhere else, but I think the steak may have been a tad overcooked. Since he was hungry, he just ate it anyway. The sweet potato fries were pretty good though. The cherry lime rickey wasn't anything special, but I think it's a nice touch that they serve it. The coffee here is like that of any diner, still good. Tom's is a nice diner that serves classic American comfort food and they do it right. It's a good option if you're feeling like diner food and you're in the area. I'm not saying you have to go out of your way to try them, but if you like pancakes, give them a try and decide for yourself if they were worth the trip! I wouldn't mind coming back for the pancakes...along with their butters.\",\n",

It was practically empty, which was super nice compared to the long line I had encountered before. \\xa0The pancake choices are AWESOME! I already knew I was going to get pancakes going into it, but the question was, which kind? \\xa0They have sooooo many different choices ranging from sweet potato pancakes, to pumpkin walnut pancakes, to even mango walnut pancakes. Like whattt???? After many minutes of contemplation, I decided to get the apple walnut pancakes, with a side of scrambles eggs. \\xa0The food came out pretty quickly and the pancakes were HUGEEE! \\xa0The pancakes were so good, like soooo good. \\xa0The walnuts gave it a nice little crunch, which was really nice. \\xa0But like I said, they were soo big, I was only able to eat two out of the three. \\xa0Now I don't know if I'll be willing to make the trip out here too often, but overall, I really enjoyed my meal.\",\n",

Bacon, eggs and sausage just piled up on the grill, which most of it tasted a little salty when served to you. Unfortunately, I did not try the pancakes.

As always, went to Yelp and saw good reviews. So I ventured over and I\\'m glad I did. Just from the outside you can tell this is a vintage style diner. Upon entering the hostess said I could sit where ever, but there is a sign that says \"wait to be seated\".The menu was relatively small, but I knew what i wanted so it didn\\'t matter. I opted for two scrambled eggs, grits, wheat toast, and turkey bacon. I had never eaten turkey bacon in my life.. It was pretty good. The eggs and the grits were great as well. Cons: Although I enjoyed my meal, a few things stuck out.1. I was never offered water maybe it was because I came from the gym and had my large smart water bottle, but isn\\'t that customary in any eating establishment.2. The place is cozy and the couple behind me were speaking rather loud. So be cognizant because you can hear others and they can hear you.3.

One other negative, which I hope gets rectified, is there was no REAL maple syrup. Aunt Jemima just isn't the same. Also, get there early, and expect a line.

(N.B.: all eggs & meat dishes come with toast and your choice of french fries or home fries.) Your standard diner fare: nothing particularly extravagant to write home about, but comforting, filling, and delicious. French fries are the extra-crispy \"double-fried\" kind.

Simply flavored but very nice (and I am kind of picky when it comes to meat). It was also a good amount.-Philly cheesesteak: the meat was nice, it is thicker than the meat of a typical philly cheesesteak so almost feels like real steak was cut up into the sandwich. The bread is very fluffy/soft which made it easier to take bites out of but was a little too soft in that it was harder to keep the sandwich together. I would have preferred it a little more toasty so that it could hold it's shape, but this is as rather minor point.-Chocolate chip pancakes: 3 large medium-thickness fluffy pancakes with oh-so-tiny chocolate chips; these tiny chips were great b/c their being smaller meant they could be spread around more rather than just having lots of globs of chocolate. They also brought 3 flavored butters (they seemed nice but I do not use butter on my pancakes so can't really comment on them). In addition, when we asked them for whipped cream for the pancakes, they weren't cheap about it and brought a very good amount which allowed me to enjoy the pancakes thoroughly.-Beef sausage: a little salty but good flavor.Overall our experience here was very good.

Their home fries are super tasty and look like more of a hash - put their sauce on it! The eggs Benedict were very tasty, however my eggs were just a bit over cooked and lacking that perfectly runny consistency I crave in poached eggs. I also tried the potato salad which was just okay, nothing special. I did get an egg cream (chocolate) which I've never tried before and it was a great drink!

The service was fast and friendly. There were so many great options on the menu that it was hard to choose but at my table we went with the Mexican omelette, veggie omelette, two eggs with sausage and crab cake florentine. And we sipped on a delicious egg cream!Everything was great, although the florentine was extremely rich...the crab cakes themselves were awesome and so was the spinach mixture underneath but the hollandaise sauce was cold and thick.

The girls and I decided to frequent the business for Sunday brunch, but little did I know how popular this location was among the locals in the neighborhood. First of all, there was a line. Thankfully it moved forward at a steady pace as customers walked in and out of the small restaurant. Free samples were served to hungry diners as they waited for a table. I had their French toast and then later their French fries with horseradish sauce. I liked both samples, especially the latter. Their horseradish sauce has a kick to it..I thought the staff was nice and cognizant of the wait line so they did their best to seat, serve, then cash out customers. There is seating outdoors in an enclosed space, where I would have preferred to be seated, but it's not spacious enough for a group of 4. There is just something about sitting near the door and seeing customers waiting on line that is a bit unnerving. You just know that this isn't a space to lounge. You dine, pay, then dash. It felt like a diner versus a restaurant with the countertop and the mementos all over the walls. From old news clips and autographed photos to awards, Tom's has been around for more than 60 years. Don't expect any of the fancy stuff like mimosas! There is no music either.The menu items were pretty cheap. You can order breakfast or lunch all day. I ordered the chocolate cake French Toast with whipped cream and strawberries. I loved it! It was definitely worth the $6.50. It was definitely sweet so I wouldn't recommend it as your first meal for the day. I'd stopped by again if I was ever in the neighborhood and looking for a cheap meal.

After I had half of the pastrami & eggs, I was already full. But of course I had to try some of the cutlet sandwich. There are TWO cutlets in the sandwich. Those two dishes are enough food for 3-4 people. The pastrami was so good - just the right ratio of fat to meat. Tender but not fatty/oily. The chicken cutlet was perfectly cooked and also tender. Food is definitely worth going back for (not to mention: BREAKFAST SERVED ALL DAY).Only reason for 4 stars is the awkward set-up of the restaurant. There isn't room for a hostess up front so when you walk in with a confused look, a waiter at the end of the restaurant will call over to you for the number of your party and gesture at a table for you - from afar.The servers wait at the bar seating (they literally sit at the bar) for food to be ready. So a corner of the restaurant-side bar seating is for the servers... and the food gets stacked on that counter (same counter where people are eating at the bar). Very strange set-up...

It\\'s only open until 4pm on Weekdays (Mon-Thurs only), but if you go during that time there\\'s no wait, as opposed to Saturday and Sunday mornings during \"brunch\" hours.

The first time I went with my roommate at 2pm on a Tuesday we ordered black & white milkshakes, crab cakes, pancakes, chocolate cake french toast, home fries, and two kinds of sausage. We were stuffed and got out under $50 for the whole bill, a blessing in this rapidly ~gentrifying~ part of the neighborhood so close to the park and museum. The chocolate cake french toast tastes like a toasted marshmallow, and if you refrigerate it at home it gets denser and is amazing cold.The savory food is great too but the breakfast food is definitely where it\\'s at.

I love my breakfast to be on the sweeter side, and these delivered. My belly was so happy with the fluffy, sweet, slightly textured pancakes. The inclusion of a trio of flavored butters is a nice touch. While I am not a big fan of butter, the cinnamon butter was very good. Luckily for me, these pancakes can stand on their own. My dining companion had the crab cake benedict and was very content. My only grievance is that they don't take credit cards.

You know the clump of potted plants and other foliage swallowing up the corner at Sterling & Washington? Or, on a weekend afternoon, the long line of people standing at these plants under a faded Coca Cola sign? Yep, that's Tom's - a ridiculously charming, cramped old diner with fun decor and delicious food. You get that sense of history upon walking in, but also an air of fun - the walls are covered in framed newspaper articles, plastic flowers, and sepia-stained photographs of people you feel you should recognize but probably don't. The menu items run the gamut of traditional things you would expect at any good diner. Their variety of pancakes and waffles sound amazing and are their claim to fame - too bad I don't like sweets for breakfast. And, GRITS!!!! What other diner in New York lets you sub grits for potatoes?!! Said grits were creamy and delightful. In no other world would I order a chili omelette but there it was on the Tom's menu, gleaming at me. The omelette was perfectly heavy and yummy (though I could've done without American cheese). The fries are great and from what I saw, the burger looked perfectly cooked. Waitstaff was very friendly. They've also got a soda fountain, which means: EGG CREAMS AND LIME RICKEYS! For when you want to forgo the craft beer or whatnot and be a true Brooklynite. When we walked past at 1pm on a Sunday, there was a line out the door. On our walk back, around 3:30pm, no more line. :) There are two rooms for seating - the main room, which is very tight, and then the bright side room, lined with windows. But the windows are shielded by all the plants outside.

I don't understand how you mess that up. Must've been some cheap bacon . Idkkk ..Maybe I'm too much of a picky eater but I don't think I'm that hard to please.

So when we first stumbled upon Tom's, we ended up coming two weekends back to back. My first breakfast meal I ordered pretty much everything. I had corned beef hash, huevos ranchero, and banana walnut pancakes. I finished half of everything, which I guess equals one full meal since I ordered two entrees. It was amazing! I was beyond stuffed silly and so ridiculously happy. I never understood the breakfast craze until Tom's. But the pancakes here were ridonkulous! We were so in LOVE with Tom's that we decided to come back the next weekend. I ordered the pastrami and eggs entree and it was equally as delicious. The pastrami was chewy and soft, and the eggs were done just right. I love the service at Tom's and the very kitschy decor. My boyfriend and I had to transfer trains and then walk 5 long blocks to get to Tom's in the brutal Winter cold but it was so worth it. I imagine that if you tried to drive here, parking would be a nightmare. 10/10 stars if I could. I'll continue to come back again and again!\",\n",

No reservations are taken and if you go during peak hours expect a wait, but they serve breakfast all day/week. We went in for Sunday brunch at around 130 and were seated right away. The patio seating is slightly cooler than the seating by the kitchen if you go during the summer.We ordered coffees (which come in cute coffee cups that vary from customer/customer or table) and a few entrees and pancakes to share. The chicken tenders, turkey club and BLT were decent for diner food and the Greek salad was huge. However the true star of the brunch were the Danish pancakes and also the lemon ricotta pancakes. They came stacked three pancakes high and they were so buttery and fluffy. Besides normal butter, there was also a cinnamon sugar butter and a strawberry butter. They were so good and filling! Only thing that could\\'ve made it better is if they offered real maple syrup.The service was also amazing, our waiter was very attentive and got our order right with all of our pesky add ons. He also chatted with us for a while and we told him how my sister had just moved to Brooklyn only a few blocks away. He came back with two delicious chocolate egg creams as a \"welcome to the neighborhood\" gift. What a kind gesture! We will certainly be back for those pancakes and to try more of their food.',\n",

Those massive, fluffy, golden disks of delicious apple pancake were phenomenal. I still dream about them! I must go back....Other than the flapjacks, they have a fantastic selection of other breakfast items: tons of omelet selections, Benedict, corned beef hash, huevos rancheros and they even have burgers for those who are into breakfast.

As we were leaving more people can in to dine and they had to wait for a table to open up - so I could see a bit of a wait happening.

What stood out to me is that the food isn't spectacular in display or with crazy flavor, it all tastes like it was just made at home.My burger was well seasoned, fries were perfect.My girl friend had the brisket sandwich, the man seemed very excited about her getting it, but it fell a little flat. she made a few.. different requests for it, and it didn't go so well.cherry lemonade made me feel like a kid again.\",\n",

       " 'So, this was an up-and-down experience. Tom\\'s is a neighborhood dive, an institution. I had read the reviews, so I was expecting some kind of a line at 10am on a Saturday morning. But what we encountered was much more than a line. My friend was like \"don\\'t worry, there are only a few people in front of us and it moves quickly. And then a guy came outside with a tray of coffee and cream, which was a lovely gesture on a chilly morning. So we waited, sipping coffee and contemplating what to order. After standing outside for close to 10 minutes, a group of people bypassed the line and just went inside. It turns out that the people at the front of the line (closest to the door) had neglected to actually look inside and see if there was a line. There was no line inside, so everyone shuffled in. That\\'s when things started to get frustrating. I understand the value of not sitting two people at a four top, but when people have been waiting in line for over half an hour and group after group gets pulled from behind them, it can start to get frustrating. It also wasn\\'t a ubiquitous practice, as there were many booths with only two people in them. It\\'s like they decided to change their seating priorities literally while we were in line. So we waited. And they brought out a tray of french fries, which were delicious, but really only served to further ignite my hunger. Finally, after what felt like an hour but was probably closer to 45 minutes of standing in line, watching other people eat, while folks are pulled from the line behind us, we finally sat down. It was slammed, so I wasn\\'t expecting great service, but I have to take off one star for never receiving any water, or any coffee refills. I had no beverage for the second half of my meal. My friend confided that the benedicts weren\\'t great, so I ordered the veggie omelet, french fries and a beef sausage. Those things were great, but not like, exquisite, like really good diner food. I would probably give four stars for the food, but the immense wait for a table, the lack of water (i specifically asked for it), and the long wait for the food and then the check make this a three start experience.Look, it\\'s fun, the food is good. Just know what you\\'re getting into. And don\\'t get the benedicts, apparently.AND BRING CASH. CASH ONLY!',\n",

This will be our new go to spot for breakfast!!\",\n",
       " 'This is a place that I\\'ve been to a handful of times and while I adore the interior and how much of its old-school charm has been preserved, I\\'ll definitely give it a \"meh\" in terms of its quality of food. The food:We ordered pancakes (regular and sweet potato) with a side of strawberries, scrambled eggs, and pork sausage, and all of it was just okay. The pancakes had a good texture, but the sweet potato pancakes didn\\'t really have a prominent sweet potato taste, and the strawberries were covered in a weird sugar water coating, with some even being rotten when we got to the bottom of the cup. The eggs were also inconsistently cooked, which I was willing to overlook, but I wasn\\'t overly impressed. Nevertheless, they always bring out a trio of flavored butters, like strawberry, to accompany each meal, which is a nice touch.The service:On weekends when the line is literally out the door, they serve the waiting customers little treats like orange wedges and cookies to keep them happy, and also, I\\'ll assume, to stop them from leaving, which I think is very cool. The servers are consistent and quick and they even gave us a free cherry lime soda without us even asking. I\\'m still not sure why, but I thought it was a sweet gesture. Atmosphere:I love that it has retained the look of an old-fashioned diner and that it is one of the few remaining establishments that his withstood the tests of time in this part of Brooklyn. It\\'s fairly small, so arrive early if you are with a large group, and there are cozy booths and black and white photos lining the walls, so it\\'s a fun place to check out at least once if you\\'re nearby.Overall, I love Tom\\'s for its authentic, old-fashioned diner feel and for the fact that all types of people from all walks of life still visit, but I think that that\\'s where my adoration stops. Nonetheless, something or someone (usually someone) keeps bringing me back here and I can\\'t guarantee that this\\'ll be my last visit. So despite not being its biggest fan, I do hope that it\\'s here to stay for many more generations to come.',\n",

He subbed in some of their blueberry ricotta pancakes instead of the plain for an additional $1.50 charge. Totally worth it. I also liked the fresh whipped butters they came with - strawberry and pumpkin! I had the corned beef hash, which was exactly how my dad used to make it for me when I was little. Came with 2 eggs and toast. Not sure if it was a slow day or if it's typical of them, but they came around to our table and a few others to give us some complimentary soda fountain drinks on the house!

We also got the cherry rickey? drink, not bad, tastes like cherry soda. I tried the different butters that everyone talked about in the other reviews but I didn't really like it. It' very different but cool, just not my kind of taste. There are a lot of workers so service is pretty quick. Although the can be very long, it moves by quickly. I like it here and would definitely come back. \\xa0On the way out, I saw a sign for their other location in coney island so might give that a try\",\n",
       " \"I'm not sure why they call it Tom's - it feel more like going to Grandma's house! From the moment you get in line by the plastic lawn chairs, to when you get seated, Tom's friendly employees are bringing you nibbles, with big happy smiles, and cheering you on as you move up the line past the potted plants. You're constantly having food offered to you, (and since you're in line waiting for a table, Tom's knows how to keep you sated enough to stay in line.) The restaurant is also very kitchy, cozy (read, crowded), and neighborhood friendly. What's not to like?After about 20 minutes in line (and one cookie, two kielbasa, and one orange slice later) we finally made it to a table. My group ordered:- pumpkin walnut pancakes- the 2x2x2 eggs pancakes sausage- turkey melt with friesAfter about 15 minutes, we received our respective, very large dishes. Everything was tasty. The pancakes were fluffy and came with three kinds of compound butter (cinnamon, strawberry, and marmalade butters). The 2x2x2 was inhaled faster than I thought was possible. And the turkey melt came with stuffing in the sandwich, which was a great add in. The pancakes could have been more pumpkiny and the sandwich a little more moist and well built, but overall the meal was really good, and I'm just nitpicking the details. Service is smiley, but can be brisque, especially if you're sitting in an area out of view. We got everything in time and in order, but I wouldn't recommend Tom's if you're in a rush. And on top of it, the value is fantastic. I would totally make this my neighborhood haunt.\",\n",
       " \"I really like this place. Be prepared to wait in a line during prime brunching hours. Food comes relatively fast and it's SO GOOD. Portions are huge and it is the best hangover cure you can imagine. If you live in the area it's worth the wait.\",\n",
       " \"I came here last year so am retroactively writing this review. As with any diner type restaurants, they have a really large menu. I came here on a Friday afternoon and it was pretty empty because they were closing early, but I've seen pictures where this place will have a line out the door. The decor was retro and the restaurant wasn't real large. Probably seating for about 30-35. After opening the menu and taking a look at it I WANTED EVERYTHING!!!! It was like a glorified diner menu with more specialty items! We ended up ordering the Mexican Omelet and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. The Omelet was pretty much what I expected and honestly I felt it tasted like any other restaurant's omelet. I was a tad disappointed with the pancakes. Supposedly they are famouse for the Lemon Ricotta pancakes, but I thought they tasted a bit plain. They didn't look all too attractive either when they came out on the plate. It just looked like a few plain pancakes on a regular plate. Nothing fancy. With so many items on the menu, I wished I got a chance to order other dishes like their daily specials. They have a big selection of specials such as the beef stew (Mondays only), Salisbury Steak, Grilled Chicken, Pot Roast (Wednesdays Only) and etc. I definitely will be coming back though because I feel I only got to sample the restaurant and from the other rave reviews I feel there is much more to offer in their other items.\",\n",

       " \"I went here for brunch last Saturday. Not too familiar still with this area in Brooklyn but slowly becoming acclaimed. My friend's lady friend introduced me to this spot though and I'm so happy to have come upon it. The only down side is that the line for waiting to get in is usually LOOOOONG. Super long. We were even late going to brunch/lunch at around 1:30 or 2pm and the line was out the door and around the corner and took about 30 minutes to finally get seated. Was it worth it?Kind of. Hm, I'd say yes. I want to come back to sample more of the menu because everything sounded amazing and I opted for a sweet instead of savory dish which I don't normally do. However, Tom's has an enormous list of pancakes and I couldn't resist. I started with an Egg Cream because I've never had one and I know it's an old timey traditional New York thing. Surprisingly it's not as heavy as a milk shake and has a light carbonation and maltiness to it. I like it. I wouldn't get it again but I approve of it. My two friends both got cherry lime rickeys. Never heard of these in my life before. But they tasted like cherry seven up and were pretty good. I'd mix those babies up with some vodka and call it my bitch. But this is not that kind of restaurant. Very mom and pop with kitschy stuff all over the walls. Garden gnomes, flowers, wreathes, etc.For my meal I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes which comes with a maple walnut flavored butter and maple syrup of course. Pancakes there are HUGE. Next time I come if I order pancakes again I'd have to split them with someone. You get three and they're incredibly fluffy. I managed to finish two and I was bursting. But the Lemon Ricotta was an interesting nice taste on the palate. I know they had more exotic ones as well: pumpkin, Danish, chocolate chip. . . And then there were various egg dishes that come with either potatoes or creamy grits. I freaking LOVE grits. Just like Britney Spears. I'm sorry. There's something wrong with me. But I really have this weird border-line obsession with grits. Okay, moving on, the only other thing I tried was their beef sausage. AMAZING. GET IT. I also hear their egg hash is impeccable.\",\n",

The pancakes were light and fluffy but I would have loved for the sweet potato flavor to have been more prominent. The strawberries were a huge disappointment. $3 for a side bowl of once frozen strawberries, not quite at room temperature??? They were mushy and sad and not what I was expecting at all.',\n",
       " \"So many Brooklyners raved about Tom's and I didn't find it all that rave worthy! When I walked into the restaurant, I was told to seat myself and for 10-15 minutes no one came to give me a menu, take my drink order, or at least greet me. I found a menu on my own and looked over it and decided what I wanted to order. The restaurant was not busy at all so I have no idea why it took so long to be served. Finally, I put in my order and had to ask for at least a cup of water because the server still never asked for my drink order. The booth I sat in had wobbling seats and the person behind me constantly pushed the seat into my back....very annoying! Finally, I got my food (danish pancakes, pork sausage, eggs over medium). The pancakes were delicious and huge. They were fluffy, light, and extremely flavorful. The eggs were cooked perfectly over medium which most cooks find it hard to do. The pork sausages were horrible! They were dry, overcooked and hard as a rock. $15 was a lot to pay for a pancake breakfast...especially given the experience I had. I most likely will not return for a round two.\",\n",

We decided to check it out, it's a small place with great flavors! It stays busy, there was a wait all three times we went, but it was quite an enjoyable wait, their staff greeted us with fresh orange slices and a cup of coffee while standing in line. That was a great first impression. We went ahead and got sat, service was fast and very friendly.

Few minutes later he came back and brought warmed up home fries from the same pile, just picked softer ones out. I accepted it, at least it was edible. Bland, flavorless, tasteless. While I was sitting there with my mom, NOT A SINGLE TIME we were offered a refill on my coffee and her tea. Lemon for my mom\\'s tea that I specifically ordered never came.

The blueberries were the perfect touch of sweet and juicy and I detected a hint of lemon zest. The pancakes were served with three little jars of their homemade butter.

They were all so good though, especially spread out on my pancakes, and I\\'m not really a butter person. I think that\\'s the most butter I\\'ve eaten in one sitting ever.

       " 'Good breakfast. Good deal. Be prepared to wait though. Luckily this past Sunday we hit the sweet brunch time slot. NO line! Unheard of...',\n",
       " 'Came here with some college friends and had an amazing time. The food is pretty cheap and the portions are huge. We each paid about $15 including tip. The service was amazing and the servers came around with free fries and free samples while we waited. The servers even gave our table free fries and a free shake at the end. I had a spinach omelette which was very good. My friends had the pancakes and enjoyed them. This is a great place for a cheap brunch and amazing service. I have never had such great service at a restaurant before.The only downside is that there is a long wait to get seated especially for groups but for the price and service, the wait is definitely worth it.',\n",
       " \"A pretty decent mom and pop place! It has a nice, home-y feel to it. I've heard that this place was popular and the line goes out the door most times but we got lucky because it was the day after Thanksgiving and they were able to seat our party of 7 together with no wait!They have your typical diner menu options. I opted for the eggs benedict because I started an addiction to Eggs Benny earlier this year and now I must try it wherever I go. It was pretty tasty! Not the best but still a delight to eat. And the home fries it came with....mmmmm mmm! I just love potatoes in general and their home fries were a nice compliment to the eggs benedict. I washed it all down with a nice warm cup of hot chocolate (because coffee makes me feel sick and nauseous).Overall, food was decent. I liked the atmosphere. Servers were friendly and prompt. If you're ever in this side of the neighborhood, give this place a try!\",\n",
       " \"Worst breakfast.. Friday. 11am. For the sake of brevity, I'll leave service out. Ordered corned beef and hash and sunny side up eggs with side of bacon. Got what looked/tasted like a 1/3 can of Hormel Corned Beef Hash and eggs cooked to crunchy. No compliments/complaints on bacon - just bacon. No toast. No homefries. Couldn't fill an 8 year old girl's stomach. Bill - $17.10. $17.10!!! Tom's used to be solid. Now, I feel like a sucker for going there. I blame the millennials.\",\n",
       " 'Perhaps it\\'s the \"Brooklyn Boy\" in me. \\xa0Perhaps I\\'ve seen one too many movies. \\xa0I\\'m not sure what it is, but if you\\'re a diner with old fashioned decor, older tables/booths, wood walls and floors and a counter to boot, you\\'ve already won half my heart. \\xa0Throw in good food, and I\\'m pretty much in love. \\xa0And so now you know the source of my love for Tom\\'s.Located on a corner of an area that wasn\\'t always so welcoming, gentrification is slowly creeping into this sector of Brooklyn, making this a destination spot for students and locals alike. \\xa0The outside looks like an old store with a white background and dark lettering. \\xa0Tons of plants surround the outside and a chalk board lists an impressive number of dishes that are part of the menu. \\xa0When you walk in there\\'s a counter to the left along with the cashier. \\xa0Based on previous reviews, I had expected a long wait but nope, my girlfriend and I were seated almost immediately at lunch time to boot!Our waiter came over quick and in no time we had water and coffee on the table. \\xa0Once we ordered, our food came within 10 minutes, nice and quick! \\xa0This gave me time to look over the place with its charming yet offbeat decor that included Christmas lights, various framed photographs and awards. \\xa0In some places this would be a mess, here it somehow works - even the stained glass windows (seriously!).My girlfriend and I had both heard the pancakes were awesome so we had to order them. \\xa0She got the mango pancakes which actually had bits of mango in them. \\xa0I liked it more than she did. \\xa0I ordered the sweet potato pancakes which, shockingly, tasted very much like sweet potato! \\xa0Add on their cinnamon butter and syrup and it was like a perfect combination.I also had two eggs sunny side up with crab cakes. \\xa0The eggs were perfectly done with the runny yolk that I love. \\xa0The crab cakes were cooked perfectly. \\xa0Cripsy on the outside with wonderful crabby goodness inside.My only complaint is the service. \\xa0My empty coffee cup went unfilled for the entire meal (a first for me at any diner) and the same can be said for our water. \\xa0Basically until we were done eating no one checked on us. \\xa0Still, for the price you\\'re paying and frankly given how the place looks and its rather...rustic nature, none of this comes as a shock.Overall I loved my experience at Tom\\'s and would go back in a heartbeat!',\n",

       " \"This place is a MUST VISIT. Don't be fooled by this wonderful restaurants facade, once inside, you'll experience that cozy diner feeling that everyone longs for.Everything on the menu is amazing and tastes well above the average diner! I'm a huge fan of pancakes and french toast in general, and I make sure to come here when I have a craving that simply won't be curbed \\xa0by your chain restaurants *cough iHop!* or by the many other local subpar diners.I enjoy coming here with friends so that we can order as much off the menu as possible and share to experience it all. Do NOT let the lines on the weekend discourage you, its worth the wait. But if you're just not in the mood for lines, come on a Monday morning if possible!Enjoy.\",\n",
       " 'This was by far the most disappointing restaurant we went to during our recent 2 week stay in the NYC area. \\xa0Because of all the hyped up reviews about this place we took transit from Manhattan to try it out, upon arriving there were a few people lining up to get seated, first impressions were the place looks like a dump. \\xa0If I were back home and went to a restaurant that looked like that I would have turned around and left. \\xa0Since we travelled a fair distance to get there and with the hopes the food would be as good as some of the reviews we decided to wait and try it. \\xa0Well, that was a mistake! \\xa0The so called \"world famous pancakes\" were dense and dry, I hate Denny\\'s pancakes but imo they are far better than the the ones at Tom\\'s and the egg dishes were no better than anywhere else, the potatoes were bland with no taste, the sausage was oozing with fat, the coffee tasted like its been sitting for quite a while, etc, etc. The experience we had at George\\'s Diner in downtown Manhattan was far far better. Save yourself some time and try George\\'s instead.',\n",
       " \"My secret little heaven in Brooklyn. I go there like once a month maybe twice, cause I don't live very close to it, but boy do I wish I did, I'd go every day probably To put it in a few words, this place is like you would want every diner to be, but it never is. This place is like that, and then some.And of course I can't not mention the pancakes. Unbeatable! The best by a lot! The staff is friendly in a familiar way, not in a pushy salesman like way.\",\n",
       " \"Finally having a normal schedule means I have weekends to enjoy brunch again. After a recommendation from my roommate, we headed over to Tom's for brunch around noon on Saturday. We had to wait in line but it was pleasant as their waitstaff brought treats for us. Orange slices, cinnamon and honey toast, and delicious french fries. The pancakes came highly spoken of from my roommate so I went with the sweet potato ones with a side of bacon and my boyfriend got chocolate chip ones with fries on the side. His sister got the eggs florentine which also looked amazing. After we woofed down our food, our stomachs were happy as could be. We will of course be back to try even more pancakes and other treats!\",\n",
       " \"I like Tom's but I don't love it. I think the only reason I'm super down with Tom's is because when I'm there I don't feel like I'm in NYC. More like home.. this diner close to my house in FL is similar to Tom's. So it's a nostalgic thing.Overall, the breakfast food is nothing too special. The eggs, bacon, sausage taste like most any other I've ever had. However, they have multiple types of pancakes you may have never seen before. The pancakes are good (not great). They are good.. not out of the ballpark good. I think if you are going to Tom's you should get the pancakes though.. The prices aren't that great. I mean 9 bucks for 2 pancakes, eggs, and bacon isn't that good of a price.On the weekends there seems to always be a wait and they have irregular hours on the weekdays.. that's why it's packed on the weekends. The service is pretty good and it does not take long to get your food.It's a laid back, fun dining experience. If you want breakfast at 6pm on a saturday it's a good idea. It is also decorated pretty cool too.\",\n",
       " \"I HAD to check this place out because everyone has been raving about it, so I decided it would be the first place I grabbed breakfast out since moving to Brooklyn.I thought it was going to be a mind-blowing experience since everyone seems to love it so much. I had to say though, I wasn't SUPER impressed, though the food was good and the portions were huge. I got a whipped ice coffee which I truly disliked all around. I get that it could go with the whole diner thing of soda water, etc, but it seriously tasted like water and a tiny bit of coffee syrup with a mound of whipped cream on top. Meh, not my favorite at all. I also got the apple cinnamon pancakes with a side of sausage (for $3 extra). The pancakes were really good, and the portion was HUGE. I had it with the cinnamon butter (I really disliked the pumpkin kind, but the strawberry was really good).I went with my boyfriend who got a hot coffee and the 2x2 deal, and our total was $27, which to me, is a little pricey for breakfast, even in New York. However everyone was nice here and it was a really good atmosphere. Maybe I just didn't order the right thing. However I'll definitely be back to try other stuff on the menu.\",\n",
       " \"Maybe it's the Jersey in me talking, but Tom's having a 4+ star average on yelp is kinda crazy to me. \\xa0With the exception of some really good meat-related sides (fantastic turkey bacon and really good sausage), the food is just kinda decent, though plentiful. \\xa0The basic pancakes are just ok, folks, don't get so excited--I've got some diners in NJ for you if you need an education in the genre. \\xa0I haven't tried the fancy pancakes with random cheeses in them, to be fair. And the service/atmosphere...it is a beehive, exactly as another reviewer said, and the tables are practically on top of each other. \\xa0Moreover, the last time I went, we (two ppl) were asked to move from one four-top to another four-top (fine, whatever), but then the hostess kept coming to take chairs from the table we moved to, asking us to get up each time, without any sort of apology. \\xa0The check gets unceremoniously thrust at you mid-way through the meal. \\xa0It's already harried enough in there, no need to make it worse.\",\n",
       " \"I love it here. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Carlos is awesome. Go early so you can avoid the wait in line, (it's not unusual for it to wrap around the block,) but even if you are waiting, they'll bring you gratis mugs of coffee and munchies! Food is always perfect, and are served in generous portions. Share an order of pancakes and an omelette so you can sample sweet and savory. Get grits. They do them right here. They play beautiful classic jazz music, and change out their kitschy decor seasonally.Go, enjoy.\",\n",
       " 'Loved the service and food the jalapeño and jack burger AMAZING!!! Sweet potato fries BANGING!!!',\n",
       " \"Amazing food, specially for brunch, breakfast... However, there is always a long line at the door so you better be prepared for cold in winter; but the experience it's definitely worth it and they bring you sth to eat every now and then to keep you warm. Lovely place!\",\n",
       " \"Went here today and tried their mango and walnut pancakes. The pancakes were no doubt extremely fluffy and light but the mangos in the pancake were of the frozen kind so they were really hard. The ham I got with my pancakes were decent. I think I'll go with the omelettes next time because they looked so damn delicious. So far, a 3 stars cause their pancake didn't impress me much. The vibe was pretty nice though, really busy but still with an amazingly calm vibe, oh and don't get me started on the decor. It's like Christmas and Easter in one room with all the Christmas lights and wall decals. Very warm and welcoming.\",\n",
       " \"Super old and run down decor and place. I get they have been around for a while, but it just looks like a hole in the wall. The portions are enormous and can feed a small army, which is good for those who like to get a lot for the dime. We were a party of 5 and the roast beef was tasteless and rubbery. The veggies on the plate were frozen and looked like warmed up in a microwave. My wrap was decent and my kids silver dollar pancakes were good too. Otherwise, nothing exciting. I think this place is great for a quick and cheap breakfast...diner styled. Otherwise, I wouldn't come back here.\",\n",
       " \"I'm not a fan of the line, or that they are cash only, but they do an efficient job seating folks and turning over tables. \\xa0I've only come for breakfast/brunch and only had eggs/pancakes. \\xa0I found the sweet potato pancakes too dense, but recently tried the Danish pancakes (ricotta, parmesan, lemon, and blueberry) and was an instant fan. \\xa0I wish I would have had room for a second serving. \\xa0There are options upon options so even picky eaters can find something they'll like and dining here won't bust your budget, which is rare in BK.\",\n",

       " \"Found Tom's just by searching for pancakes. I must say. AMAZING. I ordered the cinnamon pancakes but got to taste the broccoli cheese and veggie omelette.

Top notch, incredibly friendly, attentive and helpful. I will definitely come back and I highly recommend Tom's.\",\n",

The coffee was so delicious that I haven't been able to find any in Maryland without paying $5 for it. The service was impeccable!! Thank you for such a memorable experience!\"]"
